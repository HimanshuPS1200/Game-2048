# Game-2048

A interactive version of Game-2048, using the console as an input to take the input move from the player and use the console to display the current configuration of the board.

Following the set of rules the gameÂ gets over when either a 2048 cell has been formed, in which case the player would win. Or all the cells are filled and no valid moves are left to perform, in which case the player loses.

The whole game is created using c++ language. A proficient use of funcitons and its arguments is done. Use of appropriate data structure and struct object variable is done to make program efficient.
